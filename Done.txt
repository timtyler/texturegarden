/* Done
 * ====
 * Mutator class...
 * Mutate Seed|All|None
 * Offset
 * smaller "step" button...?
 * Invert ALL|NONE
 *  Invert flags
 *  Speed
 * "Flags" section(s)...?
 * Code to insert HFLIP settings...
 * Animation speed control...
 * Cache sine tables (performance)...??
 * "Traditional" landscape fractal?
 * Water ripple animation...
 * HMirror + VMirror
 * "UseCustomColourMap" command...?
 * Opening multiple windows onto an applet - many bugs here!
 *  Only one texture renderer active at once...!
 * FractalDrainage2
 * Alternately HMirror / Alternately Vmirror (When tiled)... NO - won't work...
 * Redraw bugs when animation is off...
 * Invert flags change when selected texture changes...
 * Invert R;
 * Invert G;
 * Invert B;
 * Texture Viewer - one huge texture with copyArea mouse movement (if static!)...
 * Lots of presets...
 * "Busy" light...?
 * Animate for N frames (only displaying a few of them?) and then stop (for RD textures)...
 * Animate all/selected/none...
 * WavesV should take arguments...
 * Mutate palette/heightmap/texture/flags/?
 * Mutation slider...
 * Mutate Sin/Bell/Isin/IBell/Sawtooth/Sawtooth2/Sawtooth3/Sawtooth4/
 * Drop shadows while dragging...
 * Pretty drag textures with drop shadows - rearrange buttons...
 * Sine wave phase animation...
 * Store offset_x and y using internal co-ordinates...
 * TextureContainers made "immune"...
 * IdleMessage class
 * Get files from ZIP
 * Fractal drainage patterns...
 * "Final" Hflip andflip (UI)
 * Reaction Diffusion
 * Translate by dragging with mouse...
 * Hardcoded (but fast) animations...+ * (Average, Multiply, etc)...
 *  Consider fast self-overlay animation routines - optimised for "multiply" and "average"...
 * Consider 1D buffer translation shortcut - using offset...? No!
 * Sin... Sawtooth...
 * Buffer numbering...
 * 1D FFTs used for wave animation...
 * Eliminate heightindex class...?
 * Do "algebraic" function height index... 
 * Commands for reading palette and heightmap...
 * Load a file button...
 * Use time variable when making noise...
 * Cellular automata fractal drainage patterns...
 * Lightning - dendrites - branches - corals - plasma balls - discharges - kirilian effects...
 * From text files...
 * Consider using big v[] rather than v[][] (not needed)..
 * Saving...
 * "Diagonal wave warp"... (almost IMPOSSIBLE)
 * Combination types: AddCeil | SubFloor | XOR | AND | OR...? | *
 * Smear 1D buffer horizontally...
 * Move regeneration code out of the redraw loop...?
 * FPS animation...
 * Classes: Program, Instruction, InstructionManager...
 *  Program has list of instructions. InstructionManager has an array of possible instructions.
 *  Each instruction is executed with a Texture as context.
 * Light sources/height map - apply light source to arbitrary image...
 * * Totalistic CA - diffusion blur...
 * "Ridge" detection?
 * DFT for non-powers-of-two
 * Fractal noise...
 * Reaction diffusion...
 * RGB saturation sliders...
 * Zebra - Invert...?
 * Presets...
 * "Range sensitive" "make image"...
 * 2 -palettes...
 * Zoom mouse control...
 * 5th slider... (6th too)...
 * Improve invertability of "Wibble wobble" jelly network...?
 * "Wibble wobble" jelly network... ;-)
 * Waves use memory better...
 * Palettes...
 * Show 1 frame in N...
 *
