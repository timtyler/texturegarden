ToDo
====
"CMD" -> buffer 0 "CMD BUFFER N" -> buffer n ;-)
Palette display... Heightmap display... (both with "master" settings...)
Get rid of "instructionNumber"...
Better encapsulation - in preparation for ripping out the back end...
Make your own buttons (with small, anti-aliased text and textured background) (TTButton)...
Flags bug when loading lots...
In-built height renderers (optimisation built-in heightmaps (to avoid expense)...
Actually use Colour map code (do layers this way?)...
* Multiple layers...
Panels:
* Texture Editor - Text editing window - with "refresh" and "QuickSave" buttons...
* Texture Lab    - knobs and sliders...
* TEXTURE_INFO / TEXTURE STATS...?
* TEXTURE PREFERENCES...?
Chequerboard...?
Anti-aliasing...
 "Cheap" additional anti-aliasing (1 4 9 16)...
 "Expensive" additional anti-aliasing (1 4 9 16)...
Deploy using JNLP...
Make "height" work properly when using DLA...?
"Transparency, Reflectivity, Luminosity, Specularity, Relief and Diffusion"...
"Lighting" section...
  Multiple light sources from configurable angles...
3D preview - using "raytracing"...
Particle systems...
Nodes/Dots...
* Craters...
* Falling rain... (smooth rain at an angle)...
* Nodes with links...
* Crumpled paper
* Delauney triangulation / Vornoi diagram...
Resizing:
 GUI resizing of textures...
 Crude "Zoom" (with UI)...?
 Resizing strategy:
* Display size...
* Texture size...
* Generation size...
 "Scalable" CA-like code...?
"Final" HMirror/VMirror...???
"Final" Swap X and Y (UI)...???
Generation display...
Sleep/ms...
Keep track of filenames for textures...
Display filenames of textures...
Bug in pointAA x,y (visible rarely on mutating SQUIRMERS)...???
Display animation_frames per second...
Allow configurable mouse buttons...
 Potato printer...
Better drawing code - with interpolation...?
Centre on canvas + "nice" redraw during resize...
"Flags section in TDL...
Buffer naming/numbering scheme....
Named variables...
Conditional statements...
Make DFT always work using integers...
"Flame" (IFS) effects...
Lisp tree parsing, with various operators...
"Broken glass" patterns...?
Edge detection (differentials)...
Sort out 2D weighted sum code...
3D preview using an animated sphere (with faked "environmental reflections")...
Ray tracer - use orthogonal projection and compensate in the model...
Scaled image is very slow with GC problems under Java < 1.4beta2... - what to do? - DIY?  Ignore it?
180-degree rotate? + 180Mirror180 ...??? Prolly not.
Patterns from Benard cells...?
Contour line diagram... - that is really a height-map...

Effects:
 Vortex swirl...
 Perlin noise?
 Veins...?
