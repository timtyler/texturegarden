# TextureGarden
Tim Tyler 2000-2022

November 2003 - first source code release.

"com.texturegarden.TG" is the main class.

There are some options at the start of that class.

If these are set correctly, it should run under Java 1.1.

There a "To Do" list.

Sparse documentation - characterises this release.

As far as I am concerned, this code is in the public domain.

Best wishes,
