      <p>Parsing an XML document on a palm pilot, was an essential issue of my 
        thesis about multichannel e-banking at a <a href="http://www.customercare.ch">software 
        company in switzerland</a>. The problem I had was parsing some XML data, 
        that I received from the InputStream of a socket and storing this data 
        in a kind of local cache before parsing. I had to get this XML data from 
        various servlets of a web banking application on a webserver. My application 
        should work online with all data, or just local only with the data stored 
        in the local cache a few online sessions before. So i needed a non-validating 
        parser that parses a String object containing the XML data.</p>

      <p>To solve my problem, I had to find a parser, that was small enough and 
        of which the source code can be changed easily in order to make it run 
        on the CLDC/KVM1.0. I knew of a parser called AElfred from <a href="http://www.opentext.com/services/content_management_services/xml_sgml_solutions.html#aelfred_and_sax">Microstar</a> 
        and its <a href="http://fujisawa.org/palm/">portation</a> onto the KVM 
        EA 0.2. The &quot;bad&quot; thing about this software portation was, that 
        it did not run on CLDC/KVM1.0 anymore because of the new generic Connection 
        framework having been introduced by this new version of the CLDC. The 
        sources of the parser itself were not wholly available, and the class 
        file of the parser itself was crypted. So there was no chance to change 
        the disassembled code anyway. </p>
      <p>I then had a look at a lot of other parsers, and checked whether they 
        would run some way on the <i>CLDC/KVM1.0</i>. They were either to big 
        (~about 80 classes) or their code was so complex, that I was not able 
        to port it to<i> KVM</i> in a reasonable period of time. I also tried 
        a parser called <i>NanoXML</i>. The distribution contained just a few 
        classes (I think there were only 2 essential classes), but unfortunately 
        the parser was too slow on KVM. The parser took about one and a half minute 
        to parse a XML data set with 8 tags and 4 attributes each. The API wasn't 
        that simple I wanted to have it. One day I found a link on <a href="http://www.xmlsoftware.com">www.xmlsoftware.com</a> 
        (definitely a good resource site for XML stuff) referencing a free, small 
        parser called <i><a href="http://www.gibaradunn.srac.org/tiny/index.shtml">TinyXML</a></i> 
        by <a href="mailto:tom@srac.org">Tom Gibara</a>.</p>

      <p>The distribution only had four essential classes and therefore was lightweight 
        enough to run on a palm pilot. The other classes supported creating a 
        tree (not DOM), representing the parsed XML data (that was not what I 
        wanted, so I left this feature out). The API is very easy to understand 
        and reminds one to the <i>SAX</i> API. </p>
      <p>You have to implement a class by extending the so called <i><b>XMLResponder</b></i>. 
        The <i><b>XMLResponder</b></i> itself is something like the <i><b>DocumentHandler</b></i> 
        in <i><b>SAX</b></i> based distributions and serves as a kind of an event 
        listener. The <i><b>XMLResponder</b></i> has a method that has to be implemented 
        in order to return an InputStream, from which the parser later reads the 
        XML data. As I mentioned above, I needed a parser, that parses just a 
        String object containing the XML data. So I implemented a <i><b>XMLInputStream</b></i> 
        which simply has a byte array, representing the bytes of a String object 
        (the XML data itself). Consequently the <i><b>XMLInputStream</b></i> simulates 
        the reading from an <i><b>InputStream</b></i>, by returning byte per byte 
        of the underlying byte array. The first step was done: I've been able 
        to parse a String containing the XML data (NOTE: I still was on <i><b>JSE1.2</b></i> 
        !).</p>
      <p>The next step was to implement two methods, that are not available in 
        <i>CLDC/KVM 1.0</i>. So I implemented those methods in a utility class 
        &quot;CharacterUtility&quot; and replaced the method calls in the code 
        of TinyXML with the corresponding calls of the methods of my utility class. 
        These methods were the following two static methods on sun's Character 
        class: </p>
      <p> 
      <ul>
        <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public static boolean Character.isLetter(char theChar) 
        <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public static boolean Character.isLetterOrDigit(char 
          theChar) 
      </ul>
      <P>The 1st method checks, whether the given character is a letter. The 2nd 
        checks, whether the character is a letter or a digit. So I implemented 
        a utitlity class &quot;CharacterUtility&quot; having these two static 
        methods. Different to sun's implementation, I did not care about the encoding 
        of the present character, because there is only ASCII encoding on palm 
        available anyway (correct my here, if I'm wrong). See the source of the 
        <a href="./tinyxml.zip">palm distribution of TinyXML</a> for details. 
      <P>Further I deleted some methods of the XMLParser class, because I did 
        not need the original provided feature of parsing DTDs. Please see the 
        <a href="http://www.gibaradunn.srac.org/tiny/index.shtml">original TinyXML 
        distribution</a> for details. Some changes also affected the XMLReader, 
        which checked the encoding of the underlying InputStream. As I mentioned 
        above, I did not need to check the encoding of the bytes. In order to 
        remove the encoding checks, I had to change the implementation of the 
        read() method of the XMLReader in a way, that the method only reads the 
        next byte of the underlying InputStream without paying attention to the 
        encoding of the character stream. 
      <P> 
        To get a more SAX-like API, I renamed the <b><i>XMLResponder</i></b> 
        into <b><i>DocumentHandler</i></b> and implemented a <b><i>HandlerBase</i></b> 
        in order not to have to implement all methods each time i write a new 
        handler. I removed the method of the XMLResponder, which returned the 
        <b><i>InputStream</i></b> to the parser and implemented a public method 
        <b><i>setInputStream(InputStream aXMLInputStream)</i></b> on the <b><i>XMLParser</i></b> 
        class in order to set the <b> <i>XMLInputStream</i></b> there and not 
        in the handler. The method setDocumentHandler(DocumentHandler) sets the 
        corresponding handler of the current instance of the parser. To get an 
        even more SAX-like API, I renamed the methods of the DocumentHandler.</p>
