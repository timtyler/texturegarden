SAX 2.0.1 (sax2r2)
29-January-2002

This is a bugfix release for SAX2, the second generation of the Simple
API for XML.  Changes from the SAX 2.0 release can be summarized as:

    - Numerous documentation improvements and clarifications.
    - Bundling the optional "SAX2 Extensions 1.0" support.
    - Bugfixes:
	* Bugfixed classes include ParserAdapter, AttributesImpl
	* Factory classes use the correct class loader (JDK 1.2 and later)
	* Some exceptions were missing default constructors
	* DefaultHandler was missing an exception spec
	* Resetting handlers to their default values is legal
    - Slightly less memory use in NamespaceSupport, AttributesImpl.
    - Better configurability for the default XMLReader.
    - NamespaceSupport enforces its declare-before-use constraint

Other than bugfixes, the APIs have not been changed.  This is intended to
be a drop-in replacement for the previous SAX2 release.  API-conformant
code will not notice any differences.

If you are using JDK 1.4, you should be able to copy "sax.jar" into
the $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/endorsed directory to have it replace the older
version of SAX2 that is distributed with that JVM.  If you're using
JRE 1.4, that path won't include the "jre".

As a SourceForge project, SAX now has public CVS access, a database
for bugs and RFEs, mailing lists, and a web site.
